Hello hi.
This is a discord bot developed by k7th, (@komeijisatofan on Twitter/X, @the7thone on Discord.)
This bot is intended to be used as a Danbooru mirror, or feed, to post updates of a user inputted tag.

Certain tags have been blacklisted by me in order to prevent the bot and/or me from being included in any legal situation. These tags can be viewed in the main.js file.

-- TUTORIAL --
To use the bot, you need to have ManageChannels permission. 
To start, do :

db!post <channel> <tag of your choice>

for example, 

db!post #channel komeiji_satori

There can only be 1 tag per channel.

To change the tag for a specified channel, you do the same command, for the same channel, but the tag that will replace the original tag will be in the <tag of your choice> position. 
Also, make sure the tag you add has posts and also has no mistakes regarding syntax.
